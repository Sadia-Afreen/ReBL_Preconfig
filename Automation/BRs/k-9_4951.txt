Bug Report Title:
Disney+ html mail - padding issue

Bug Report Issue:
**Describe the bug**
There is a padding at the left and bottom of the mail. Maybe also at the top. These paddings shouldn't be there (atleast not for an html email, maybe ìt's default css?)
[disney+.zip](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/files/5250639/disney%2B.zip)

If I display the same html mail in Firefox (Desktop) oder Thunderbird, then there is no padding.

I don't have any preferance regarding "Disney+ Email" above the image. That's just the title element in the html head.
No preferance whether it's useful to display this html title or not and whether it should have the same background color etc. as the body ^^

Comment#1:
The HTML starts like this:

```html
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%" style="min-width: 100%; " class="stylingblock-content-wrapper"><tr><td class="stylingblock-content-wrapper camarker-inner"></td></tr></table>

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:v="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml" xmlns:o="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office">
  <head>
    [...]
    <title>Disney+ Email
    </title>
  </head>
<body leftmargin="0" topmargin="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"         style="width:100% !important;-webkit-text-size-adjust:none;-ms-text-size-adjust:none;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;margin-right:0;margin-left:0;padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0;padding-right:0;padding-left:0;background-color:#ffffff;background-image:none;background-repeat:repeat;background-position:top left;background-attachment:scroll;"><style type="text/css">
div.preheader 
{ display: none !important; } 
</style>

[...]
```

This is clearly broken. We won't invest any time trying to add special support for this.

Comment#2:
What are you talking about, the table at the top with no content? ^^
Probably a workaround for one mail client. I wouldn't consider it broken, even though I don't like it, but html mail in general is ugly so what can you do?

The easiest thing to do: don't parse anything outside of the html tags (except the doctype)

Comment#3:
maybe they forgot to remove it and got the code from here or it has to do with that framework

Comment#4:
I removed the table, saved the file, opened it in thunderbird and forwarded it to myself in order to to open it with K9 on my smartphone, same issue

ok it's not exactly the same file, because thunderbird removed lots of stuff from the header like the title (maybe other places, too) and encoded it as quoted-printable, but the issue with the padding remains (top, left, bottom).

Comment#5:
interesting, thunderbird now has a similar padding for the mail I changed while the original mail shows no padding in Thunderbird.

If you don't want to investigate further, then I fully appreciate that.
I want to apologize for the spam in this thread.

Comment#6:
I looked into this some more. The "Disney+ Email" text is showing because the `<table>` tag starts the body and everything that is meant to be part of `<head>` ends up in the body, including the `<title>` element. Because `<title>` is not on our list of allowed tags for the body, it is filtered out and only the text remains.
Interestingly browsers' default stylesheet contains a rule to hide the contents of title elements. See [this blog post](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/css-hidden-elements). If we don't filter out `<title>` tags the text will be hidden. I see no harm in making that change.

The second issue is that we discard all attributes from the `<body>` element. That's not good and something we will fix as well.

But even with these changes there will remain a tiny gap at the top for now. That's because of the layout of the message view screen. We'll get to overhauling that eventually.

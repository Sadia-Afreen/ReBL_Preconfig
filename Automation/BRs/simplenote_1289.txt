Bug Report Issue:
<!--
Please, be as descriptive as possible.  Issues lacking detail, or for any other reason than to report a bug, may be closed without action.
-->
When typing a potential link in the note, something like `wp.com`, the link is autodetected and the word is underlined. When taping on it, the toolbar above displays three action buttons, the first being the one to open the link in the browser. When you tap that icon, the link doesn't open in the browser.

There is no issue with full links that do contain `https://` such as `https://wp.com`.

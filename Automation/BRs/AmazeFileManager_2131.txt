The moving works fine :) But, something else is broken!

I tried moving an image from one folder to another one - and then from there to the root folder. It got updated instantly in the gallery. After that, I deleted the image. But then, the record popped up in the gallery at these three positions!! But, opening them gives me the image not found screen as usual.

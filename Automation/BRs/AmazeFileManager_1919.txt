Bug Report Issue:
**Describe the bug**
After giving storage permission normally, rotating the screen and clicking the back button will prevent you from using the app normally

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Install and open AmazeFileManager
2. Click on "ALWAYS ALLOW" to give storage permission
3. Rotate the screen
4. Click the back button of the phone
5. The displayed file will be empty as if I didn't have storage access

**Expected behavior**
I can still see my files and use AmazeFileManager normally

**Consequence**
When this problem occurs, I will never see my files in AmazeFileManager no matter how I restart the application. I had to re install AmazeFileManager to record this error

**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**
 - Device: galaxy a6s
 - OS: Android 8.1.0
 - Rooted: No
 - Version: v3.4.3

**Additional context**
I also made some additional attempts. I found that if you manually open the storage permission of AmazeFileManager in the system settings before opening AmazeFileManager, this error will not occur, as shown below. Therefore, I think the reason for the error should be related to the permissions.

I think this is a separate issue. This happens for one more flow as well, I'll list it here.
 Let me pick this up.

1. Go to 'Unified Inbox'
2. Pull Down - Nothing happens after the loading-circle finishes
3. Go to 'Account Name'
4. Pull Down - Mail show up after cirlce is done

Email are beeing fetched when refreshed either in the background or in Unified Inbox


**Environment (please complete the following information):**
 - K-9 Mail version: 5.728
 - Android version: 11, LineageOS
